      Dissertation: Understanding the Bestowing of Enantioselectivity to Heterogeneous Catalysts via the Addition of Chiral Modifiers
        - Designed and developed the in-situ ATR-IR absorption spectroscopy system to probe the interactions between chiral molecules and metal surfaces (Pt, Pd, Pt-Cu alloys) at the liquid/solid interfaces.
        - Developed kinetic measurements to estimate correlations between the adsorption modes of the chiral molecules and the enantioselectivity performance in asymmetric hydrogenations of Œ±-keto esters.
        - Skilled with in-situ ATR-IR, NMR, BET surface analysis, GC, GC-MS,TEM,ICP-OES, surface modifications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
